This stage may take many hours and averages about nine hours in a first labor.The second stage occurs from four to five centimeters to complete dilation and is accompanied by the descent of the presenting part to about halfway or more down the birth canal. Usually, dilation occurs more rapidly in this stage than the first. The cervix usually opens at least one to two centimeters per hour during this stage, so that whole second stage is two and a half to five hours. The third stage of labor is the expulsion of the placenta, or afterbirth, which can take five minutes to a half hour after delivery.
Should I get an epidural or not#It is impossible to answer that question until you are in labor.

Is it common to have pragnancy# In our tertiary care facility with about five thousand deliveries per year, well over 80 percent of women choose epidural anesthesia.
How long does it take to push the baby all the way out#That varies tremendously. On average, you can expect to push about one and a half to three hours with a first baby.
